In this mini project, a series of bioinformatics tasks was carried out using the human TNF gene as the gene of interest. 
NCBI was used to retrieve the nucleotide sequence of the gene. It was then translated into amino acid sequence, determined ORFs in the sequence and carried out sequence composition using BIOEDIT tool.
PROMO tool was used for identification of transcription factor binding site. MEME tool was used for the identification of functional motifs in the genome or transcriptome.
Then GENSCAN tool was used for predicting coding and non-coding regions in the TNF sequence. Finally the TNF sequence in FASTA format was then converted to PHYLIP format.
