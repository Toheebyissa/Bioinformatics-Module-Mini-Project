In this mini project, a series of bioinformatics tasks was carried out using the human TNF gene as the gene of interest. 
NCBI was used to retrieved the nucleotide sequence of the gene. It was translated into amino acid sequence, determined ORFs in the sequence and carried out sequence composition BIOEDIT.
PROMO tool was used for the identification of transcription factor binding site. MEME tool was used for the identification of functional motifs in the genome or transcriptome.
Then GENSCAN tool was used for predicting coding and non-coding regions in the sequence. Finally the sequence in FASTA format was converted to PHYLIP format
